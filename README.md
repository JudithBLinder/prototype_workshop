## Prototypes: Clementine and Winston

This is a workshop intended to make you think about prototypes and inheritance! We will be constructing two methods that allow us to both create classes, and to create and extend a class immediately. While there are fancy new ways in ESNext to make this easier, you should also test your knowledge by trying to do this using pre-ES2015 functionality.

### How to Use
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run test:watch`
3. Read the source code in `src/index.js`. Read the test code in `test/index.test.js`, write the body of the `createClass` and the `extendClass` functions. Change `xit` to `it` to have the test run. Work until all tests are passing!
